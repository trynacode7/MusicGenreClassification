# Music Genre Classification using GTZAN Dataset

## Overview

This project implements machine learning models to classify music recordings into genres using the GTZAN dataset. The project compares different approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) and deep learning (CNN) for music genre classification.

## Objectives

- Classify music recordings into 10 different genres using extracted features and spectrogram images
- Compare performance of Random Forest, SVM, and CNN models
- Implement both batch prediction and near-real-time prediction capabilities
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## Dataset

The project uses the GTZAN dataset which contains:
- **Audio files**: 1000 music recordings (100 per genre) in WAV format
- **Genres**: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock
- **Features**: Pre-extracted features in CSV format (3-second and 30-second segments)
- **Spectrograms**: PNG images of spectrograms for CNN training
